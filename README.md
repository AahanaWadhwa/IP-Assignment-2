Main task is, given a set of points, find the pair of closest points.
This is achieved in the following two ways:
- Using brute force approach, which is O(n^2)
- Using a divide and conquer approach, which is O(n log n)

The brute force approach is implemented in the following function:
naive_closest_pair

The divide and conquer approach is implemented in the following function:
efficient_closest_pair
